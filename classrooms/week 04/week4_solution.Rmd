# By hand or Latex syntax in a .Rmd file
Most of these exercises are easiest solved by hand. However, if you want to write math notation in an R-markdown Latex-syntax can be used. Below are some examples of how latex is used to write math equations. Remember to surround your equation by either $ $ or $$ $$. Feel free to ask for me if you want to learn some latex syntax.

$\frac{5}{10}$

$$
x^{\frac{a}{b}}=\left(x^a\right)^{\frac{1}{b}}=\left(x^{\frac{1}{b}}\right)^a=\sqrt[b]{x^a}
$$
# 1.1

# 1.2

# 1.3

# 1.4
```{r}
# Simple graphing 
f <- seq(-10,20, by = .01)

y <- (-160/9) + (5/9)*f

plot(x,y, type = 'l')

```

# 1.6

# 1.15

Expected effect is here the expected change in homicides per 100,000

# 1.22
Figure out what the modulo operator does and solve the exercise

The modulo operator is simply implemented in R by %%

```{r}
# Example
5 %% 2 
```

```{r}
print(113 %% 3)
print(256 %% 17)
print(45 %% 5)
print(88 %% 90)
```
