# Exercises from Chapter 3
## Warm-up: Practicing vector and matrix notation
Consider the following predictions
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{y}_1=47=50+3.0 *(-1) \\
& \hat{y}_2=-50=50*(-1)+3.0 * 0 \\
& \hat{y}_3=109=50*2+3.0 * 3
\end{aligned}
$$
Try to write the prediction in vector notation. If you further want to challenge yourself try Matrix notation as well. (if you are stuck have a look at pages 36-37 in ROS). It might be helpful to do this exercise by hand.
